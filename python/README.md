# Python REST/Thrift Examples

These examples demonstrate how to use the HBase client to serve as a REST or 
Thrift gateway to Google Cloud Bigtable.

Bigtable REST/Thrift Gateway support is reliant on patches being merged
into the open-source HBase client. We are currently working on getting
these patches merged into the HBase release, but until that happpens you can 
either use our HBase releases or apply our patches yourself. See the READMEs 
in the samples for details. Google is *not* forking HBase, we are working to 
get all these patches merged into official HBase releases.
